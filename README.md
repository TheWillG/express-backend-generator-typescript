# Express Generator Backend Typescript
This generator is powered by TypeScript, Express, Mongoose/MongoDB, log4js, and Joi.

## Overview
This generator is a CRUD app generator with server-side validation on all requests based on the model definitions.  It is driven by an input yaml file (generatorConfig.yml) that is read by the generator. The main schema of the input config file is:
```yaml
# generatorConfig.yml

# replace all CAPITAL_NAMES with your own custom fields
app:
  name: APP_NAME
  resources:
    MODEL_NAME_1:
      variables:
        MODEL_FIELD_1: PRIMITIVE_TYPE
        MODEL_FIELD_2: PRIMITIVE_TYPE
        MODEL_FIELD_3: PRIMITIVE_TYPE
```
